# Study Time Tracker

This is a simple Python program that helps you estimate how many hours you are on track to study in a week based on how many hours you studied today. It is meant to give you a quick idea of your weekly study habits and encourage consistent effort.

The program asks for your study hours for today, converts your input into a number, and then calculates an estimated weekly total. It also includes basic error handling, so it won’t crash if you accidentally type something that is not a number.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
python app.py
